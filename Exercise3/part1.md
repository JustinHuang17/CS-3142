**Excercise 2.1**
The difference between *int, long, long long, and short* is the size of bits that each type can hold. Int and short can hold 16-bits of information, long can hold 32-bits and long long can hold 64-bits of information
Unsigned and Signed type differ from each other based on the range on number the variable can hold. Unsigned type can only represent numbers greater than or equal to 0 but signed type can represent positive and negative numbers as well as 0.
Floats and Doubles differ in the amount of integeres that each can store. Both do not have a set amount of bits that they can store but rather a set amount of significant figures. Floats saves up 6 sigfigs and Double saves 12 sigfigs from the value.
**Exercise 2.2**
I would use int for the payment value and principal since we would be dealing with monetary values that only have 2 decimal points to deal with. For the rate I would use type float to ensure that any calcuation with the rate would be accuate.

**Exercise 2.10**
Global_str does not have a value to print.
Global_int has a value of 0
Local_int has a random value assigned
Local_str does not have a value to print.
**Exercise 2.12**
 (B)(C)(D) are the invalid names.
 **Excercise 2.13**
 Int i will have the value of 100 in the program
 **Excercise 2.14**
 The program is legal and int i has the value of 100 and sum has the value of 45.
**Excercise 2.17** 
Int i has the value of 10 and ri also has the value of 10.
**Excercise 2.27**
(A) - Created an int i with value -1 and pointer r to reference the value 0
(C) - Created an const i with value -1 and pointer r to referebce the value 0
(G) - Created an int const i2 with the value that i has and created a pointer r pointing to i.
